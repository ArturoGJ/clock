## [Clock](https://editor.p5js.org/ArturoGJ/present/aIS-icFkY) ðŸ•°
This project is just that, a Clock that displays time.  
What I like about this project is that I made it so everything in it resizes itself depending on the diameter of the clock.
I had to use trigonometry for the lines representing 5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40, 50 and 55 minutes to resize and so that they stay in the same place with the same direction, even though it's not complex at all I thought it was pretty cool.
